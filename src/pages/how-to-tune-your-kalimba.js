            <h2 className="container mx-auto text-gray-700">First, we need some tools for you to retune your Kalimba. Basically we need the hammer, not the utility hammer you are using to pound the nails, it’s the little hammer included in your kalimba package. Well, if you lose your Tuning Hammer, don’t worry because a lot of online store are selling tuning hammer separately. I will post some links below where you can buy them separately. Second, you need a tuning application or software, either on your mobile phone or computer. For this article, I’ll be showing DaTuner for android phones. Third, is we need the table or guide for accurately tune our Kalimba which is shown below. Lastly, we need to know what is the base tuning of our Kalimba if we fixing the tunes or what notes are we aiming. For this example, I will show the C Major Standard tuning for 17 Keys Kalimba.</h2>

And then locate which tines you will tune. For our example, let us choose A4 or 6 in notation. We only have two things we can do to change the tune. First is hitting the tines from above will lower the tunes and second is hitting the tunes from below will make the sounds higher. Be careful when hitting the tines not to hit other nearby tines. Hit just one or two times then pluck the tines your are tuning. The tuner on your mobile phone will start moving up or down while showing the tone it recognize.</h2>

            <h2 className="container mx-auto text-gray-700">2. We need to check the HZ (hertz) in our chart, in our case should be 440hz.</h2>
            <h2 className="container mx-auto text-gray-700">3. Lastly, we need to have the yellow line reach the top and turned all yellow colors to green.</h2>
